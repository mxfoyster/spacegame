# spacegame
A space invaders style game in JavaScript

## Aim

This is just to practice some JavaScript animation and DOM manipulation in a fun way. Due to the nature of what I am trying to do, it will be necessary to have 
synchronous events (ie an Update style loop) that will be effected by asynchronous events (key input) which should be fun.

## Important note

I am being 'good' this time and using the traditional staggered (opening on same line) curly braces as more traditionally used with JavaScript and css. I don't really like it this way, I prefer my braces to line up but I am trying to demonstrate that:

* I Know that they are supposed to be done this way in these languages

* I can change the way I do things to comply to 'in house' standards.
