# spacegame
A space invaders style game in JavaScript

## Aim

This is just to practice some JavaScript animation and DOM manipulation in a fun way. Due to the nature of what I am trying to do, it will be necessary to have 
synchronous events (ie an Update style loop) that will be effected by asynchronous events (key input) which should be fun.
